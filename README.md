<p>
    Dr Sheldon is a DocRepair font intended for improving document compatibility
    with the ISO/IEC 29500 standard. Dr Sheldon is based on Fraunces, a display, old-style soft-serif typeface inspired by the mannerisms of early 20th century typefaces such as the Cooper Series. Fraunces was designed by Phaedra Charles and Flavia Zimbardi, partners at <a href="http://www.undercase.xyz">Undercase Type</a>.

## About

DocRepair is a collection of fonts intended for improving document compatibility with the ISO/IEC 29500 standard.

## Building

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions - take a look in the "Actions" tab for the latest build.

If you want to build fonts manually on your own computer:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

The proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Actions - look at https://docrepair-fonts.github.io/dr-sheldon-fonts.
