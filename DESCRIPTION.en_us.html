    Dr Sheldon is a DocRepair font intended for improving document compatibility
    with the ISO/IEC 29500 standard. Dr Sheldon is based on Fraunces, a display, old-style soft-serif typeface inspired by the mannerisms of early 20th century typefaces such as the Cooper Series. Fraunces was designed by Phaedra Charles and Flavia Zimbardi, partners at <a href="http://www.undercase.xyz">Undercase Type</a>.
